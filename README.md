# React HomePage

> About a half year ago I made a homepage for myself into my browser when I used jquery to make it. But since then I learned a lot and now I am mainly using react so I decided to remake it. And now I learned about browser extension a lot so I am gonna use it as well.

## Some sample photos about it:

### Main

![sample1](./client/sample_photos/sample1.png)

### Settings 1

![sample1](./client/sample_photos/sample2.png)

### Settings 2

![sample1](./client/sample_photos/sample3.png)

### Settings 3

![sample1](./client/sample_photos/sample4.png)

### Settings 4

![sample1](./client/sample_photos/sample5.png)

### Favorite edit popup

* [x] Fixed clock animation
* [x] ~~Fix responsivibilty on Settings (and Firefox compatibleity [backdrop-filter])~~
* [x] Also publish it into chrome (Firefox submition done. Should I publish it for others too?) -> published on chrome for testers
* [x] Make popup component to the settings reset button.
   * Check reactjs-popup (https://react-popup.elazizi.com/component-api/)

   * [ ] Menupoint like 'All' and 'Selected' or 'Chosen'
   * [ ] Show all events button (maybe above the calendar)
   * [ ] Create, remove and edit events
   * [ ] If there is any event today show it on the right side
* [ ] After exporting make the changes instead of a simple reload
* [ ] Browser popup
   * [ ] Add the actual page to favorites
   * [ ] Make new event
* [ ] Update marketing_side on version update

   * [ ] Adding the actual site to favorites by popup.
   * [ ] Access to history
