# React HomePage

> About a half year ago I made a homepage for myself into my browser when I used jquery to make it. But since then I learned a lot and now I am mainly using react so I decided to remake it.

## Some sample photos about it:

### First Sample

### Second Sample

### Third Sample

## To Do:

* [ ] Change the favorites order by drag-and-drop
* [ ] Background color changing
* [ ] Background Image change?
* [ ] Should I store datas locally? Or should I write a server side for it?
