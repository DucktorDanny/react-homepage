# React HomePage

> About a half year ago I made a homepage for myself into my browser when I used jquery to make it. But since then I learned a lot and now I am mainly using react so I decided to remake it. And now I learned about browser extension a lot so I am gonna use it as well.

## Some sample photos about it:
