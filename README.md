# React HomePage

> About a half year ago I made a homepage for myself into my browser when I used jquery to make it. But since then I learned a lot and now I am mainly using react so I decided to remake it. And now I learned about browser extension a lot so I am gonna use it as well.

## Samples, description and usage:

* [x] ~~Greeting pronouns and emojis settings fix~~
* [x] Fixed clock animation

   * [x] Change greeting settings' method
   * [x] Chrome scrollbar width problem
   * [x] Warning for adding nothing to favorites
   * [ ] Function separatings?
* [ ] Calendar events
   * [x] By clicking on a date popup calendar events 'settings'
   * [x] Menupoint like 'All' and 'Selected' or 'Chosen'
   * [ ] 'Show all events' button (maybe above the calendar -> the calendar and the button should be in a div and then we should change the animation a bit)
   * [ ] Create, remove and edit events
   * [ ] If there is any event today show it on the right side
* [x] Popup and Calendar Events onClose and onDecline when user click outside of the panel
* [ ] After exporting make the changes instead of a simple reload

   * [ ] Add the actual page to favorites
   * [ ] Make new event

* [ ] Close popup when user click out of it?

* Other ideas:
   * [ ] Slidable/scrollable favorite list (right-letf)
   * [ ] Background Image change?
   * [ ] Adding the actual site to favorites by popup.
   * [ ] Access to history
   * [ ] Access to bookmarks and set favorites by that (opporunity to make own favorites)
