# React HomePage

> About a half year ago I made a homepage for myself into my browser when I used jquery to make it. But since then I learned a lot and now I am mainly using react so I decided to remake it.

## Some sample photos about it:

### First Sample

## To Do:

* [x] Fix Safari style issuescd 
* [x] Background color changing ( changing the top of linear graditent  RGB with sliders )
* [x] Settings open always at the top of the form
* [ ] Set up local storage
* [ ] Background Image change?
* [ ] Editable favorites?
